ImgLib2 is a general-purpose, multidimensional image processing library.

It provides an interface-driven design that supports numeric and non-numeric data types (8-bit unsigned integer, 32-bit floating point, etc.) in an extensible way.
It implements several discrete data sources and sample organizations, including one single primitive array, one array per plane, n-dimensional array "cells" cached to and from disk on demand, and planes read on demand from disk.
